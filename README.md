# ðŸ“Š Sales Dashboard (SQL + Python)

A data-driven **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built with **MySQL, SQLAlchemy, and Pandas**.  
This project runs complex SQL queries, automates data extraction, and generates clear **CSV outputs and visual insights** â€” making sales reporting faster, smarter, and more interactive.

## Whatâ€™s inside

- `dashboard_charts.py`: runs 4-5 SQL queries, saves CSVs to `output/`, generates charts (if enabled).
- `connect_mysql.py`: sample MySQL connection (SQLAlchemy).
- `sql/`: any reusable SQL snippets.
- `output/`: CSV results (and optional charts).
- `requirements.txt`: project dependencies.

## ðŸ“Š Queries Covered

This project explores the `sales_dashboard` database to answer real-world business questions, helping stakeholders understand **customers, products, revenue, and regions**.

1. **Top Customers by Revenue** â€“ Highlights the top 5 customers driving the highest sales revenue.
2. **Monthly Revenue Trend** â€“ Tracks revenue growth patterns over time (by year and month).
3. **Top Selling Products** â€“ Identifies the most frequently purchased products.
4. **Category-wise Revenue Contribution** â€“ Shows revenue share across different product categories.
5. **Region-wise Sales Performance** â€“ Compares sales performance across regions to assess market strength.
6. **Top Products by Sales Revenue** â€“ Calculates revenue per product, considering **quantity Ã— price Ã— discount**.
7. **Revenue by Region** â€“ Analyzes total revenue per region by combining customer, product, and discount data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Outputs

Along with SQL queries, this project generates **data visualizations** using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib).  
Each chart is saved as a PNG file in the `output/` folder.

- **Top Customers by Revenue** â†’ Bar chart showing top 5 customers.
- **Monthly Revenue Trend** â†’ Line chart displaying sales growth over months.
- **Top Selling Products** â†’ Bar chart of most frequently purchased products.

## How to run

1. Create `.venv` and install deps:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   rements.txt
   ```

## ðŸ“‚ Sample Outputs

Example CSV outputs are stored in the `output/` folder.  
Example chart images can be generated and saved (if enabled).

**Top Customers by Revenue (sample):**
| Customer Name | Total Revenue |
